A Basic Webgame all about avoiding mines!

This workspace contains two projects, one in normal JS and the other using React. They are wholly separate, with individual packages, dependencies, etc. The basic-js version is more complete in terms of game functionality, but the react version should satisfy all required project criteria.

Run commands from inside the webapps-project directory!

To run the basic-js version:
- cd into the basic-js directory
- run npm update as needed
- run command: npm run dev
  - local dev server is hosted via express on locahost: 3000

To run the react version:
- cd into the react-app directory
- run npm update as needed
- run command: npm run server
- open a second cli terminal
- run command: npm run client
  - local dev server is hosted via exprss on localhost:5137
